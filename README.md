# This Is (Probably) Not The Repo You're Looking For
This is a 'dry run' of the repo move that we will be doing for the COVID Safe Paths app.  Unless your name is Steve or Ken, there's really nothing good here for you to look at.  This repo will be deleted soon.

## What we are doing...
FYI, this started as:
  https://github.com/test-mobileapp
Then got renamed to:
  https://github.com/test-nearly-safe-paths
  
Soon we will move this to the https://github.com/Path-Check organization
